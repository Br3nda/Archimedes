# Welcome to the Archimedes!

## Installion Guide
### Pull down Archimedes Server
Pull down the git repository for archimedes which is a Drupal 6 code base with an Archimedes install profile. But before you install it you'll need to also pull down the Drupal archimedes client and archimedes library.
`cd Archimedes/sites/all/modules`
`git clone https://github.com/fiasco/Archimedes-Client-Drupal.git`
Enter into the Archimedes client and read the README file which will tell you to checkout the Archimedes library files.

### Install the Server
#### Requirements
* A web server like Apache 2 of Nginx
* PHP 5.2 or greater configured to run with your webserver
* PostgreSQL (8.3+ recommended) or MySQL (5.0+ recommended)
* A dedicated email account
_Note that this has only been installed with Linux and is highly recommended that you use it._
Archimedes uses Drupal's standard installation practice of an installation profile. Create a Database and virtual host entry for your server and follow the Drupal installation process selecting the Archimedes install profile at install time.
### Configuration
Browser to http://mysite.com/admin/archimedes and setup the email account settings. As per Drupal's configuration, add a cron task to run drupal cron regularly for Archimedes to check for new emails.

Now your running and Archimedes server. Next step is to get clients reporting to you!
